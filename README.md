# Credit_Risk_Analysis
## Overview of the project

Utilizing Machine Learning statistical algorithms to make predictions based on data patterns provided on credit risk. Supervised Learning using a dataset was the choice of myself and my colleague Jill, since the data includes a labeled outcome.

Various Machine Learning models were used to train and evaluate the data. Due to the dataset used contained unbalanced data (good loans vastly outweighed fradulent loans), the models of choice were:

  - RandomOverSampler
  - SMOTE 
  - ClusterCentroids
  - SMOTEENN
  - BalancedRandomForestClassifier
  - EasyEnsembleClassifier
